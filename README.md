Title of the project: Joggingpal


Software specifications:
This project consists in the development of a Windows application aimed at runners and jogging
 enthusiasts. The application allows registered users to organize and participate in events, 
 that is appointments in which groups of users (e.g. groups of friends or members of a sports team) 
 go running together. After each event participants can compare results. Events can be of two types: 
 in-person-events in which participants meet up and run at the same location, or virtual events in 
 which participants go running at the same time, however each one at a different location chosen 
 independently. Registered users can also create user groups, which can be signed up to events as 
 a whole by the group administrator. Users can join or leave a group at any time. As a future 
 development, the application will allow the creation of multi-level user groups, so that user groups 
 can join other groups.
